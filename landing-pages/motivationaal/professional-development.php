<p><img src="img/coaching-rocks1.jpg" align="left" style="padding:10px;">I understand that success is frequently decided by how well we handle the unexpected, the unwanted and the unpredictable.</p>

<p><strong>I know that if I want different things to happen in my life, I’m going to need to do things differently.</strong></p>

<p><h3>My approach to success coaching is unique in the field.</h3></p>

<p>My work with clients in both professional development and personal development is as strongly influenced by my martial art training – as it is by my psychology background, research into leadership skills, and my experience as a therapist, peak performance specialist, and management consultant.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean that I try to turn clients into fighting machines or secret agents. It does mean, however, that I help those interested in professional development  learn effective leadership skills to perform at their best.  I help those thinking in terms of  personal development achieve their  professional and personal goals by becoming stronger, more flexible, and more resourceful – especially at at the times in their lives that it is important to be as effective, or motivated, or creative as possible.</p>

<p>Leadership Skills create happiness. There are a lot of variables in choosing a coaching focus.</p>

<p>I work with people from a broad range of professional development backgrounds; sports, business, education, the law, the arts, and more and more – people who simply want to do a better job at living their lives.</p>

Often people want to figure out how to do more with what the have – and how to get better results – with what they’re doing. On the other hand, people frequently want to figure out how to do less – so they can enjoy what they have – more.</div>

<h4>I coach most of my clients long distance</h4>

<p><Usually we work together once a week at a pre-scheduled time. We talk by phone, or by Skype, Instant Video Messaging, FB Video, etc.</p>

<p>Professional Development and Personal Development coaching sessions are typically 45 minutes in length, but I ask new clients to schedule 60 to 90 minutes for our first session. In addition to our regular sessions, you can call or e-mail me throughout the week for quick-touch brainstorming, strategizing, and to share sudden insights, unexpected frustrations and surprise victories.</p>

<p>To keep us moving in the right direction, I frequently assign specific personal or professional development goal-related tasks (homework) for you to do between our sessions. I believe that what we do counts more then what we feel – and that the only way we can get somewhere is to get up and GO!</p>
<h4>Call or e-mail me and we’ll set up an initial phone meeting</h4>

<p>Some coaches call this a “free coaching consultation”, but really, we interview each other. During this meeting, I try to get a sense of your personal style, your current situation, and your overall goals.</p>

<p>In order to give you a feel for my style of coaching I also try to give you something that I feel will help you start moving in the direction you want to go – now. You try to get a sense of my personality and whether you feel I understand you well enough to help you in the way that you need.</p>

<p>I will e-mail or fax you a coaching assessment packet to fill out and send back to me. This information is important and is the basis for our first few coaching sessions. It allows us to use our time effectively right from the beginning.</p>

<h4>The Process</h4>

<p>Unlike a lot of personal and professional development coaches, I don’t use contracts.</p>

<p>I do ask that we start with an initial three month coaching agreement to give our work together a chance to start working. If, however, you don’t feel that you are getting what you need from coaching, you can stop at any time.</p>

<p>Fees can be paid either by credit card, pay-pal, or direct bank deposit, and are due at the beginning of the month. Arrangements can always be made for more intense work, meeting with greater or lesser frequency, face-to-face meetings, and team/group/family coaching.</p>
