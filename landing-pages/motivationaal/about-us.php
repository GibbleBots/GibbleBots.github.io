<p><img src="img/edmond-otis-about-us-picture.jpg" align="left" style="padding:10px;">Edmond Otis combines experience as a psychotherapist, peak-performance coach (executive and sport), author, Distinguished University Lecturer, and more than four decades of traditional martial arts training– to create motivational speaker events and seminars that are exciting, entertaining, and relevant to every audience.</p>

<p>Edmond, a  New Zealand Resident since 2008, and a Senior Lecturer in Sport and Health Science at the Eastern Institute of Technology (EIT),  travels frequently between North America, Australasia, and Europe for speaking, training,  and  seminar  presentations. Before Edmond and his family moved to NZ, he was a Senior Lecturer in Humanities and Director of Martial Arts at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) – the largest collegiate martial arts program in the United States.</p>

<p class="panel" align="center">Edmond’s unusual background and real-life experience give him a perspective on success, peak performance, personal strength, communication, conflict, strategy, and problem solving that is truly unique.</p>

<h3>Martial arts strategies for personal development, professional development, and organisational success…</h3>

<p>As a motivational speaker, Edmond does more than simply entertain – he motivates audiences to be fearless. Not in the sense of taking unnecessary risks, or acting out of character. But fearless in the truest sense; being able to focus on a goal clearly, strategize effectively, act decisively, and communicate persuasively – when results are important, and the outcome matters. </p>


<p><img src="img/edmond-otis-about-karate.jpg"  align="right" style="padding:10px;"> With small executive groups or large audiences, Edmond combines a hands-on approach, and cutting-edge research, with classic martial art strategies and solutions to address our most difficult personal, professional and orginisational challenges.</p>

<p>As a success coach for personal and professional development, Edmond depends on the same resources to help individuals and organizations successfully address a broad range of professional, personal, and interpersonal challenges and opportunities.</p>

<p>In the martial arts, Edmond has practiced traditional Shotokan karate since 1967 and is internationally known as an instructor, competitor, coach, and judge. An 8th degree black-belt, he has coached numerous competitors to USA national and international championships, and has personally developed many high-ranking instructors.</p>
