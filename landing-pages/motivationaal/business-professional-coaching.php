<p>I focus a lot on the concept of being “fearless”, and sometimes this gets misunderstood. I don’t mean fearless in the sense of taking unnecessary risks, or acting out of character. But fearless in the truest sense; being able focus clearly on a goal, strategize effectively, act decisively, and communicate persuasively – when results are important – and the outcome matters.</p>

<p>What do martial-arts, Professional Development, and Leadership Skills,  have in common? Well, when we look beyond the funny clothes, the rituals, and all the yelling, we see that the martial arts are about more then just fighting — they are about learning to master yourself so that you truly are your best – when you really need to do your best.</p>

<p>My Professional Development, Leadership Skills and Business Coaching one-on-one and small-group sessions</p>

<p>I help you prepare for the challenges you face in your professional life, which can range from helping you sharpen your leadership skills and career management instincts within an organization, to helping you jump start your entrepreneurial mind set.</p>

<p>The goal, however, is always narrow and specific — develop the personal strengths, interpersonal savvy and unexpected strategies that will help you make a substantive impact and lead to real professional success.</p>
