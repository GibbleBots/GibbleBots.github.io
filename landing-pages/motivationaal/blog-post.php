<p>In the final piece of my 4-part series on resiliency, I want to focus on <strong>stress management skills and training. </strong></p>
<p>Previously, in our focus on how to become resilient, we’ve talked about:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to <a href="http://www.edmondotis.co.nz/how-to-discover-your-peak-performance-mind/">discover your peak performance mind</a></li>
<li>How <a href="http://www.edmondotis.co.nz/how-your-communication-skills-can-help-you-become-more-resilient-and-overcome-anything/">communication skills can improve your resiliency</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Being resilient is about learning to accept, embrace, and <em>actually take advantage</em> of the stress you encounter on a daily basis. The difference between a resilient person and one who cowers from stress is as simple as learning the skills necessary to manage stress.</p>
<h2>What is stress management?</h2>
<p>We all encounter stress regularly. Mental, physical, and emotional stressors attempt to disrupt our lives. A resilient person doesn’t see these stressors as impossible walls to scale. Rather, they see these stressors as challenging obstacles. With every obstacle there is always a solution, always a way to get around to the other side.</p>
<p>You just need the clarity and wherewithal to figure it out. If you’re bogged down by stress, however, you’ll likely struggle to think clearly and come to solutions. In fact, the more stress you feel, the bigger the obstacle appears to you.</p>
<p>Stress management is often associated with the workplace, but chances are you experience stress in all aspects of your life, from work to home and everywhere in between. A proper stress management-training program will help you to manage stress in every faction of life.</p>
<p>Training programs will help you to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Control information overload</strong> – When we’re inundated with too much at once, we’re like a river cresting. We can’t handle this influx, thus we spill over.</li>
<li><strong>Remain calm and focused</strong> – Stress is a powerful thing. It has the ability to elevate your heart rate and force your mind to race. That, in turn, only increases your stress levels.</li>
<li><strong>Improve organization</strong> – One of the best ways to reduce stress is to be organized in your life.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce stress in others</strong> – Stress is a whole lot like yawning. When one person yawns, the rest of the room follows suit. If one person exudes stress, the rest of a group might fall in line.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stress management isn’t a DIY program</h2>
<p>Despite our minds and bodies wanting to be at peace, getting there is anything but natural. Learning the skills necessary to remain at peace, and to view a roadblock as a challenge, does not come easily.</p>
<p>That’s why so many individuals, business owners, and leaders seek the help of a <a href="http://www.edmondotis.co.nz/professional-development/">stress management expert</a>.</p>
<p>As a personal and professional coach, I offer stress training seminars and workshops throughout Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada. My stress management seminars are designed to be the building blocks toward creating resiliency in your life and/or workplace.</p>
